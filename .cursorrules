# Auto Claude - Project Rules

This project uses the **Auto Claude** system for automated documentation, task tracking, and architectural insights.

## Core Directories

- `.auto-claude/insights/`: Session history and AI-generated insights.
- `.auto-claude/roadmap/`: Long-term project roadmap and milestones.
- `.auto-claude/specs/`: Detailed requirements and implementation plans for features.
- `.auto-claude/ideation/`: Brainstorming and early-stage feature definitions.

## Agent Behavior

1.  **Context First**: Before starting any task, always check `.auto-claude/insights/current_session.json` and the latest session file in `.auto-claude/insights/sessions/`.
2.  **Follow Specs**: Check `.auto-claude/specs/` for any existing implementation plans or requirements related to the task.
3.  **Update Progress**: After completing a task or a significant phase, update the relevant files in `.auto-claude/`.
4.  **Auto-Sync**: Use `./claude.sh sync` to synchronize code changes with the documentation.

## Documentation Standards

- All feature tracks must have an implementation plan in `.auto-claude/specs/[feature-name]/implementation_plan.json`.
- Maintain a clear changelog in `conductor/CHANGELOG.md` (shared with Conductor).

## Integration with Conductor

- **Auto Claude** works alongside **Conductor** (Gemini).
- Both systems should be kept in sync.
- Use `conductor/` for shared documentation and `.auto-claude/` for Claude-specific insights and planning.
